          <h2>Why sponsor MinneHack?</h2>

          <p>
            MinneHack is a fun, exciting, and dynamic
            event. Sponsoring MinneHack is a wonderful opportunity to
            meet students and prosective hires. Mentors and judges
            work closely with participants, and they get to see how
            their teams collaborate to solve tough problems. In
            addition, sponsorships are a great way to advertise your
            product or service and build up your brand. MinneHack is
            strongly tied to the Twin Cities tech community and
            sponsorships can help you tremendously to get the word
            out!
