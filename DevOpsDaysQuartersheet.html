          <h2>Why sponsor Minnehack?</h2>

          <p>
            Minnehack is a fun, exciting, and dynamic event. Sponsoring Minnehack
            is a wonderful opportunity to meet students and prosective
            hires. Mentors and judges work closely with participants, and they see how
            they solve problems and work with their team. In addition,
            sponsorships are a great way to advertise your product and build up
            your brand. Minnehack is strongly tied to the Twin Cities tech
            community and sponsorships can help you get the word out!
